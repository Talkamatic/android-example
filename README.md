This repository contains an example Android app, showing how to integrate with the TDM Android Frontend Library.

In order to try, you need to get a few things right.
1. Add the tdmFrontend-x.x-release.aar to testapplication/libs
2. Make sure testapplication/build.gradle points to the right version of the .aar from step 1.
3. Open the repository root in Android Studio and run the testapplication module.
